# Gesture-recognition-assignment

For Upgrad EPGP course:

Recognising 5 different hand gestures viewed by a camera

We've sample images used to test the features

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie
 

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images). In the next couple of lectures, our subject matter expert Snehansu will walk you through the structure of the dataset.
